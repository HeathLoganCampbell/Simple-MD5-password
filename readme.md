# `Simple MD5 password cracker`
While at the University of Auckland (UoA), We had to crack a hash for a password, given `username:salt:password` where the username and pass were known.

## How to use
### Installing
 * NodeJs
 * VS code?

### Run
cd to the directory of this readme then run the following commands
`npm install`
`npm start`

which installs the md5 depency then the second command runs the program (Note: you only need to run `npm install` once).

Then you can go to `./configs/config.json` and edit the username, salt and password.
as well as add more words to the `./configs/list.json` if you would like.
